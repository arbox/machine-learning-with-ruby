# Wait but why?

There are a lot of software lists with ML related tools. There are a couple of lists
with Ruby related projects. There are no lists of only working and tested
software with documented scope. We'll try to make one!

What is awesome? Awesome are documented, maintained and focused tools.

Can something turn not awesome at a point? Yes! Abandoned projects with broken
dependencies aren't awesome any more! They leave this list.
